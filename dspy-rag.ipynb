The Long Answer While Android is open source and can be modified to suit many devices, firmware and hardware drivers are most often not made readily available -- especially not the source code. Android wont run on a device without drivers for that specific device, so this means that you cant simply compile the code for Android and run it on your phone. Android is a very different operating system than other phone platforms; Android and Windows Phone 7, for example, are just as different as Ubuntu and Windows 7 for the PC. This means that even if you have WP7 drivers for your device, those drivers wont work on Android. Youll have to modify those drivers to be compatible with Android, and you may need to reverse-engineer a lot of code. This is very difficult and time-consuming, and sometimes even a team of people have little success with it. Even getting a new version of Android to run on an Android phone can be hard. The upside is that many phone manufacturers are now putting out versions of the same device with different operating systems. One example is the HTC HD2, which runs Windows Mobile 6 but is very similar to the Android HTC Desire Z. The Desire Z ROM only requires slight modification to run on the HD2. Android ROMs/projects for non-Android Phones Various developers have gone through the effort of creating an Android ROM that can be installed on other devices, or have started to do so. The following statuses will be used to describe each project/ROM: Pre-alpha: Concept stage. You cannot use Android at all yet. Alpha: Android is technically usable, but many major features are missing. Beta: Most major Android features are usable, but its fairly buggy. Complete: This is almost as good as real Android! Unknown: Its, well ... unknown. Apple iOS Devices There used to be a project iDroid for porting Android 2.3 to a jailbroken iPhone (2G or 3G), but the project died in 2014 without ever becoming stable.

Alpha x86 Tablets/PCs The Android-x86 project develops distributions of Android for x86-based systems, such as Apple Macs, most Windows PCs and tablets. Some Android devices already have x86 SoCs, such as the Dell Venue series and the HP Slate series. Android-x86 comes with the GRUB bootloader, which allows it to be dual-booted with Windows/Linux/OS X. It can be installed to a hard drive/SSD partition during initial setup. There is no LiveCD functionality in Android-x86. It is regularly updated with the latest Android version. For more information about Android-x86 and more specific help, look at our frequently asked android-x86 questions. Feel free to add to this answer as new ROMs come out for more devices!', 'Android is an OS specifically designed for resource constrained environment. Android manages resources intelligently, and will kill applications when other applications need to use memory, and resurrect them later to restore service. Unlike some other phones, which sacrifices basic smartphone functionality, like multitasking, by only allowing one running application at a time). As for how Android determine how to resurrect apps, its mainly determined by Intents. Applications can register to be notified by the OS when certain events occur, e.g. the phone starting up, youre entering a particular location, the wifi gets turned on, etc. When handling notifications (Intents), the application (or parts of it) may get resurrected. In a sense, conceptually in Android, all installed applications are always running all the time and you have conceptually infinite memory. The OS will kill and resurrect applications as needed to maintain this illusion.', 'Each version of Android since 1.5 has been developed with a specific codename. These codenames are chosen alphabetically and have thus far all been dessert items (or, generically, sweet/sugary foods). Some codenames are associated with more than one version number, while others are limited to only a specific one, and the reason for this inconsistency is not currently known. The naming typically appears to correspond to changes in the developer API levels, but this is not always true (example: 3.0 and 3.1 are both Honeycomb but they have different API levels). The following names are used for the currently existing Android releases. Note that versions 1.0 and 1.1 were not publicly named. However, Android 1.1 was internally referred to as Petit-Four (noted in Traroths answer, confirmed here): Cupcake: Android 1.5 Donut: Android 1.6 Eclair: Android 2.0 Android 2.1 Froyo: (short for frozen yogurt) Android 2.2 Gingerbread: Android 2.3 Honeycomb: Android 3.0 Android 3.1 Android 3.2 Ice Cream Sandwich: Android 4.0 Jelly Bean: Android 4.1 Android 4.2 Android 4.3 KitKat: Android 4.4 Lollipop: Android 5.0 Android 5.1 Marshmallow: Android 6.0 Nougat: (official name: https://twitter.com/Android/status/748642375908589568) Android 7.0 Android 7.1 Oreo: Android 8.0 Android 8.1 Pie: Android 9.0 Android 10 (no codename) Android 11 (no codename)', 'Android version are always device specific. Therefore you cant use Android from device X and copy/clone it to a different device Y. The main reason for this is that each Android version contains a number a device drivers for all the different components (graphics chip, GPS, camera, sensors, hardware keys, main CPU). Each driver has to be the correct driver in the correct version configured in a correct way. Otherwise nothing will work If you have problems with a new Android device there is only one way: Check on https://lineageos.org if there is a custom ROM version for your device. With a little bit of luck such a version exists and there is a way to install it on your devices. Note that installing a custom ROM results in loosing the warranty for your device. If something goes wrong with the installation of the custom ROM there is always the chance to brick the device.', 'Unfortunaltely, all Android devices will have a different set of secret codes. Some of them are specific to some devices, some others arent. Secret Codes are generally defined by the applications installed on the device. If you want to have a valid list of secret codes available on your device, you should use an automated secret codes crawler. Then you can search online for its meaning. I recently developped an Open Source app that crawls AndroidManifest.xml files on your device to found secret codes, and allows you to execute the secret codes available on your device. You can get it on the Play Store or on the GitHub repository Android-Secret Codes.'],\n",

      "    passages=['As far as I remember, High Memory is used for application space and Low Memory for the kernel. Advantage is that (user-space) applications cant access kernel-space memory.', 'HIGHMEM is a range of kernels memory space, but it is NOT memory you access but its a place where you put what you want to access. A typical 32bit Linux virtual memory map is like: 0x00000000-0xbfffffff: user process (3GB) 0xc0000000-0xffffffff: kernel space (1GB) (CPU-specific vector and whatsoever are ignored here). Linux splits the 1GB kernel space into 2 pieces, LOWMEM and HIGHMEM. The split varies from installation to installation. If an installation chooses, say, 512MB-512MB for LOW and HIGH mems, the 512MB LOWMEM (0xc0000000-0xdfffffff) is statically mapped at the kernel boot time; usually the first so many bytes of the physical memory is used for this so that virtual and physical addresses in this range have a constant offset of, say, 0xc0000000. On the other hand, the latter 512MB (HIGHMEM) has no static mapping (although you could leave pages semi-permanently mapped there, but you must do so explicitly in your driver code). Instead, pages are temporarily mapped and unmapped here so that virtual and physical addresses in this range have no consistent mapping. Typical uses of HIGHMEM include single-time data buffers.', 'This is relevant to the Linux kernel; Im not sure how any Unix kernel handles this. The High Memory is the segment of memory that user-space programs can address. It cannot touch Low Memory. Low Memory is the segment of memory that the Linux kernel can address directly. If the kernel must access High Memory, it has to map it into its own address space first. There was a patch introduced recently that lets you control where the segment is. The tradeoff is that you can take addressable memory away from user space so that the kernel can have more memory that it does not have to map before using. Additional resources: http://tldp.org/HOWTO/KernelAnalysis-HOWTO-7.html http://linux-mm.org/HighMemory', 'The first reference to turn to is Linux Device Drivers (available both online and in book form), particularly chapter 15 which has a section on the topic. In an ideal world, every system component would be able to map all the memory it ever needs to access. And this is the case for processes on Linux and most operating systems: a 32-bit process can only access a little less than 2^32 bytes of virtual memory (in fact about 3GB on a typical Linux 32-bit architecture). It gets difficult for the kernel, which needs to be able to map the full memory of the process whose system call its executing, plus the whole physical memory, plus any other memory-mapped hardware device. So when a 32-bit kernel needs to map more than 4GB of memory, it must be compiled with high memory support. High memory is memory which is not permanently mapped in the kernels address space. (Low memory is the opposite: it is always mapped, so you can access it in the kernel simply by dereferencing a pointer.) When you access high memory from kernel code, you need to call kmap first, to obtain a pointer from a page data structure (struct page). Calling kmap works whether the page is in high or low memory. There is also kmap_atomic which has added constraints but is more efficient on multiprocessor machines because it uses finer-grained locking. The pointer obtained through kmap is a resource: it uses up address space. Once youve finished with it, you must call kunmap (or kunmap_atomic) to free that resource; then the pointer is no longer valid, and the contents of the page cant be accessed until you call kmap again.', '/proc/meminfo will tell you how free works, but /proc/kcore can tell you what the kernel uses. From the same page: /proc/kcore This file represents the physical memory of the system and is stored in the ELF core file format. With this pseudo-file, and an unstripped kernel (/usr/src/linux/vmlinux) binary, GDB can be used to examine the current state of any kernel data structures. The total length of the file is the size of physical memory (RAM) plus 4KB. /proc/meminfo This file reports statistics about memory usage on the system. It is used by free(1) to report the amount of free and used memory (both physical and swap) on the system as well as the shared memory and buffers used by the kernel. Each line of the file consists of a parameter name, followed by a colon, the value of the parameter, and an option unit of measurement (e.g., kB). The list below describes the parameter names and the format specifier required to read the field value. Except as noted below, all of the fields have been present since at least Linux 2.6.0. Some fileds are displayed only if the kernel was configured with various options; those dependencies are noted in the list. MemTotal %lu Total usable RAM (i.e., physical RAM minus a few reserved bits and the kernel binary code). MemFree %lu The sum of LowFree+HighFree. Buffers %lu Relatively temporary storage for raw disk blocks that shouldnt get tremendously large (20MB or so). Cached %lu In-memory cache for files read from the disk (the page cache). Doesnt include SwapCached. SwapCached %lu Memory that once was swapped out, is swapped back in but still also is in the swap file. (If memory pressure is high, these pages dont need to be swapped out again because they are already in the swap file. This saves I/O.) Active %lu Memory that has been used more recently and usually not reclaimed unless absolutely necessary. Inactive %lu Memory which has been less recently used. It is more eligible to be reclaimed for other purposes.

Highmem areas are for use by user-space programs, or for the page cache. The kernel must use tricks to access this memory, making it slower to access than lowmem.

Lowmem is memory which can be used for everything that highmem can be used for, but it is also available for the kernels use for its own data structures.

Amount of free lowmem. MmapCopy %lu (since Linux 2.6.29) (CONFIG_MMU is required.) [To be documented.] SwapTotal %lu Total amount of swap space available. SwapFree %lu Amount of swap space that is currently unused. Dirty %lu Memory which is waiting to get written back to the disk. Writeback %lu Memory which is actively being written back to the disk. AnonPages %lu (since Linux 2.6.18) Non-file backed pages mapped into user-space page tables. Mapped %lu Files which have been mmaped, such as libraries. Shmem %lu (since Linux 2.6.32) [To be documented.] Slab %lu In-kernel data structures cache. SReclaimable %lu (since Linux 2.6.19) Part of Slab, that might be reclaimed, such as caches. SUnreclaim %lu (since Linux 2.6.19) Part of Slab, that cannot be reclaimed on memory pressure. KernelStack %lu (since Linux 2.6.32) Amount of memory allocated to kernel stacks. PageTables %lu (since Linux 2.6.18) Amount of memory dedicated to the lowest level of page tables. Quicklists %lu (since Linux 2.6.27) (CONFIG_QUICKLIST is required.) [To be documented.] NFS_Unstable %lu (since Linux 2.6.18) NFS pages sent to the server, but not yet committed to stable storage. Bounce %lu (since Linux 2.6.18) Memory used for block device bounce buffers. WritebackTmp %lu (since Linux 2.6.26) Memory used by FUSE for temporary writeback buffers. CommitLimit %lu (since Linux 2.6.10) Based on the overcommit ratio (vm.overcommit_ratio), this is the total amount of memory currently available to be allocated on the system. This limit is adhered to only if strict overcommit accounting is enabled (mode 2 in /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_ratio). The CommitLimit is calculated using the following formula: CommitLimit = ([total RAM pages] - [total huge TLB pages]) * overcommit_ratio / 100 + [total swap pages] For example, on a system with 1GB of physical RAM and 7GB of swap with a overcommit_ratio of 30, this formula yields a CommitLimit of 7.3GB. For more details, see the memory overcommit documentation in the kernel source file Documentation/vm/overcommit-accounting. Committed_AS %lu The amount of memory presently allocated on the system. The committed memory is a sum of all of the memory which has been allocated by processes, even if it has not been used by them as of yet. A process which allocates 1GB of memory (using malloc(3) or similar), but touches only 300MB of that memory will show up as using only 300MB of memory even if it has the address space allocated for the entire 1GB. This 1GB is memory which has been committed to by the VM and can be used at any time by the allocating application. With strict overcommit enabled on the system (mode 2 /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory), allocations w'],\n",

      "High memory and low memory in Linux refer to two distinct segments of the system's memory that are used for different purposes. Low memory is the portion of memory that the Linux kernel can access directly and is statically mapped at boot time. This memory is used for kernel operations and data structures. High memory, on the other hand, is not permanently mapped in the kernel's address space and is used primarily for user-space applications. When the kernel needs to access high memory, it must first map it into its address space temporarily. This distinction is crucial for managing memory efficiently in a 32-bit architecture, where the kernel must handle both user processes and hardware devices while ensuring that user-space applications cannot directly access kernel memory.\n",
